# Dustin-Johnson-s-Incredible-2020-Season
Is an overview of Dustin Johnson's incredible season on the PGA tour.

## Dustin Johnson's Inspiration for the 2020 Season
Dustin Johnson is obviously a magnificent golfer and currently holds the #1 in the world golf rankings. From the beginning of June to Novemeber of 2020 Dustin Johnson has won 4 times, including a Tour Championship victory at East Lake and a Masters victory at Augusta. DJ has always been thought of one of the most talented players on tour, but has for some reason come up short in Major tournaments. This much success in a given year is extremely rare for professional golfers and may have to do with his fiance's father **Wayne Gretzky**. Wayne Gretzky is the best hockey player to ever lace up the skates and is extremely competitive, and he reportedly gave DJ this advice before coming into the year, "*“I don’t mean he has to be Tiger — you only get a few athletes like that a century. But part of what made Tiger Tiger was relentlessness.”* Obviously this impacted DJ as any man once to win the approval of their father in law and with the prestige of Wayne Gretzky it gave him that much more motivation.
